# QtAsteroids
Simple collidings of objects in Qt (based on QtPainterGame)

This is my first (not perfect yet) rep project where I use my default template project based on Qt Painter. 
It supports on Android using NDK. Default physic supports a convex colliding with lines or spheres.
It can save high scores into file: win uses main app folder, Android uses default location for app 
in Android/data/org.barsikgame.asteroids/files/download/game_data.txt
Main Android settings are configured in Android manifest file.
